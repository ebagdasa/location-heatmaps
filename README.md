# Towards Sparse Federated Analytics: Location Heatmaps under Distributed Differential Privacy with Secure Aggregation

This directory contains code to experiment with differential
privacy on location heatmaps.
Here is the example of the algorithm running on NYC location map from 
[NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/reader-center/phone-data-location-investigation.html):

To experiment with the code there is a working [notebook]
(dp_location_heatmaps.ipynb).
